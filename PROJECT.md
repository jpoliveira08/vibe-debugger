# AI Release Assistant - Error Monitoring & Decision Support System

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Vibe Debugger  
**Type**: Proof of Concept (POC)  
**Primary Goal**: Intelligent release monitoring and automated error analysis system


## Solution Overview

An AI-powered release assistant that automatically monitors New Relic Error Inbox, analyzes error patterns, correlates them with recent releases, and provides actionable recommendations for release management decisions.

## Core Objectives

1. **Real-time Error Analysis**: Monitor New Relic Error Inbox continuously
2. **Release Correlation**: Identify if errors are related to recent deployments
3. **Decision Support**: Provide clear recommendations (rollback/hotfix/monitor)
4. **Context Enrichment**: Integrate with GitHub and JIRA for comprehensive analysis
5. **Automated Troubleshooting**: Suggest potential fixes and root causes

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **New Relic MCP Server** (Primary Integration)
   - Error inbox monitoring
   - Metrics collection
   - Alert management

2. **GitHub MCP Integration**
   - Code analysis
   - Commit history review
   - Pull request correlation

3. **JIRA MCP Integration**
   - Release notes analysis
   - Known issue tracking
   - Ticket correlation

4. **AI Agent System**
   - **Pattern**: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Agentic AI
   - **Framework**: LangGraph for workflow orchestration
   - **Monitoring**: LangFuse for AI system observability

5. **Chat Integration**
   - **Slack Bot**: Interactive troubleshooting and recommendations
   - **Discord Bot**: Alternative chat platform support
   - **Conversational AI**: Natural language error analysis and guidance

### Technology Stack

- **Primary Language**: TypeScript
- **MCP Servers**: TypeScript
- **AI Framework**: LangGraph
- **Monitoring**: LangFuse
- **Chat Platforms**: Slack API, Discord API
- **Integrations**: New Relic API, GitHub API, JIRA API

## POC Core Components

### Essential Features
- [ ] New Relic MCP server (error inbox monitoring)
- [ ] AI agent with ReAct pattern for error analysis
- [ ] Slack/Discord bot integration for chat-based interaction
- [ ] Basic recommendation system (rollback/monitor/hotfix)
- [ ] Mock data and demo scenarios

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] GitHub MCP integration for code context
- [ ] JIRA integration for release correlation
- [ ] LangGraph workflow orchestration
- [ ] LangFuse monitoring

## POC Success Criteria

1. **Chat Integration**: Working Slack/Discord bot that responds to error queries
2. **Error Analysis**: AI can analyze New Relic errors and provide recommendations
3. **Interactive Troubleshooting**: Users can chat with AI to investigate issues
4. **Decision Support**: Clear rollback/hotfix/monitor recommendations via chat

## MVP Features for POC

### Core Chat-Based Functionality
- **Slack/Discord Bot**: Interactive chat interface for error troubleshooting
- **Error Query**: Users can ask "What errors happened after the last deployment?"
- **AI Analysis**: Conversational error analysis and pattern recognition
- **Recommendations**: Chat-based rollback/hotfix/monitor suggestions
- **Context Gathering**: AI asks follow-up questions to better understand issues

### Chat Interaction Examples
- **User**: "Are there any critical errors from the last release?"
- **AI**: "I found 3 new errors since deployment. Let me analyze... The database timeout errors look concerning. Would you like me to check if this is related to the recent database migration?"
- **User**: "Yes, and should we rollback?"
- **AI**: "Based on error frequency and impact, I recommend a hotfix. The issue seems isolated to user authentication. Here's what I found in the code..."

### Optional Enhancements
- **GitHub Integration**: AI can pull code context during chat conversations
- **Historical Context**: "This error pattern was seen 2 weeks ago and fixed in PR #123"
- **Proactive Alerts**: Bot sends alerts to channels when critical errors are detected

## Key Features

### Automated Error Analysis
- Real-time error detection and classification
- Pattern recognition for recurring issues
- Severity assessment based on impact metrics

### Release Correlation
- Timeline analysis comparing errors to deployment times
- Code change impact assessment
- Rollback recommendation scoring

### Intelligent Recommendations
- Risk assessment for each detected error
- Suggested actions with confidence levels
- Alternative solution pathways

### Context-Aware Insights
- Code-level analysis for error root causes
- Historical issue correlation
- Team notification and escalation paths

## POC Expected Outcomes

- **Proof of Concept**: Validate the core idea works with real New Relic data
- **Team Buy-in**: Demonstrate potential value to stakeholders
- **Technical Feasibility**: Confirm MCP + AI integration is viable
- **Next Steps**: Clear roadmap for full implementation if approved
